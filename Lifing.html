    <p><h3> Life is complicated but you have to hang on there and wait to see what's going to happen when all this is over</h3></p>
<p>So, the basic strategy is to align your trading actions with the prevailing market sentiment. If you believe that a particular currency pair, stock, or asset is in a bullish trend, you may consider buying it in the hope of selling it later at a higher price. Conversely, if you believe that the market is bearish, you may consider selling it (or not buying it in the first place) in the anticipation of buying it back at a lower price.
    It's important to note that market sentiment can change over time, and markets can transition from bullish to bearish or vice versa. Traders use various tools and analysis methods, such as technical analysis and fundamental analysis, to assess market conditions and make informed buying and selling decisions.
    Additionally, risk management is crucial in trading. Setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, and managing your position sizes are essential practices to help protect your capital when implementing these strategies. Always ensure that you have a well-defined trading plan and clear risk management rules before entering any trade.</p>
